# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to provide visulal representations of the ride sharing data to make the data more easily understandable. Futhermore, the ride sharing visuals are meant to promote ride sharing access to future customers of Pyber and determine cost. 

## Results: Using images from the summary Dataframe and multiple-line chart, describe the difference inn ride-sharing data among the different city types

The figure 1 chart shows the amount of revenue produced by the service is relatively steady over the time studied. The Urban cities generate the most profit, followed by suburban then rural. 

given that there are more people in urban areas, it makes sense that there would be the most profit in urban areas vs. rural.

This summary figure allows us to see certain things the first figure did not. IN this Figure you can see more easily that there is a significant gap in total rides between urban and rural cities. you can also see the same gap in total drivers.

### Conclusions

1. Urban cities generate the most profit for Pyber.
2. Riders in urban cities have a cheaper ride fare than both suburban and rural. This also mean that drivers in urban areas make less money per ride.
3. Rural area customers have more expensive fares than either urban or suburban.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. Instead of just reviewing the data over the last 4 months, consider gathering data to analyze over the course of the whole year. This will give you a clearer picture of the data as a whole.
2. Perform a new market study in rural cities to see if it is justifiable to increase the amount of drivers. 
3. based on the data analyzed, the amount of drivers in suburban areas should be increased to meet the demands of the given riders.
